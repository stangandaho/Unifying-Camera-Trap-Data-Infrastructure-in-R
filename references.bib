abstract = {As the capacity to collect and store large amounts of data expands, identifying and evaluating strategies to efficiently convert raw data into meaningful information is increasingly necessary. Across disciplines, this data processing task has become a significant challenge, delaying progress and actionable insights. In ecology, the growing use of camera traps (i.e., remotely triggered cameras) to collect information on wildlife has led to an enormous volume of raw data (i.e., images) in need of review and annotation. To expedite camera trap image processing, many have turned to the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and use machine learning models to automate tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in images. To contribute understanding of the utility of AI tools for processing wildlife camera trap images, we evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art computer vision model developed by Microsoft AI for Earth named MegaDetector using data from an ongoing camera trap study in Arctic Alaska, USA. Compared to image labels determined by manual human review, we found MegaDetector reliably determined the presence or absence of wildlife in images generated by motion detection camera settings (≥94.6% accuracy), however, performance was substantially poorer for images collected with time-lapse camera settings (≤61.6% accuracy). By examining time-lapse images where MegaDetector failed to detect wildlife, we gained practical insights into animal size and distance detection limits and discuss how those may impact the performance of MegaDetector in other systems. We anticipate our findings will stimulate critical thinking about the tradeoffs of using automated AI tools or manual human review to process camera trap images and help to inform effective implementation of study designs.}
