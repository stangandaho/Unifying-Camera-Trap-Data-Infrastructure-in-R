# Project plan

## Start-up phase
The project is currently underway and has received support from the R Consortium for the first grant cycle (25-ISC-1-04). The project's GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/stangandaho/ct)

## Technical delivery
- *Month 1:* Integrate MegaDetector (v6) with the ct package
- *Month 2:* Build a prototype Shiny GUI for image/video upload, detection, and annotation
- *Month 3:* Expand GUI to support metadata editing, tagging, and export of annotated datasets.
- *Month 4:* Conduct extensive unit testing with real-world datasets for most package functions.
- *Month 5:* Develop comprehensive tutorials/vignettes covering end-to-end workflows.
- *Month 6:* Finalize documentation, prepare dissemination materials, and submit delivery blog post.


## Other aspects
The project is released under MIT license. All code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/stangandaho/ct). 
Project progress and results will be publicized through:  
- Delivery blog posts on the R Consortium blog.  
- Social media (at this time on LindedIn) updates and ISC meetings.  
Tutorials and vignettes will be published on the package [website](https://stangandaho.github.io/ct/index.html) under **Articles** section.

## Budget & funding plan
The project will progress through three well-defined milestones, each with dedicated budget allocations.  

Milestone 1: Core Integration Layer (Completed)
This milestone established the foundation of the project by developing standardized interfaces to connect ct with camtraptor, camtrapDensity, and Distance. These integrations enable smooth data exchange between packages and provide users with a consistent workflow. Key functions for common data transformation, analysis, and visualization were implemented, making ct a practical and user-friendly tool for camera trap data processing (e.g currently in use by [Gilles Adounke](https://doctorat.univ-toulouse.fr/as/ed/cv.pl?mat=172968&site=EDT) for his PhD program).

Milestone 2 ($4,000): Automated Annotation  
It will deliver a lightweight interface for deep learningâ€“assisted animal detection, streamlined tools for metadata extraction and editing, and utilities for efficient dataset construction.

Milestone 3 ($4,000): Documentation, Testing, and CRAN Submission  
The final milestone will ensure ct is well-documented, tested, and accessible to the R community. It includes developing comprehensive documentation with tutorials, and submitting the finalized version to CRAN for public release in compliance with R packaging standards.
