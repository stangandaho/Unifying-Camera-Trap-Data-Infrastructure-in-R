# Project plan

## Start-up phase
The project is currently underway and has received support from the R Consortium for the first grant cycle (25-ISC-1-04). The project's GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/stangandaho/ct)

## Technical delivery
- *Month 1:* Integrate [MegaDetector (v6)](https://microsoft.github.io/CameraTraps/megadetector/) with the *ct* package, providing R functions to run detections on images and videos.
- *Month 2:* Develop a prototype Shiny application included within the package for image/video upload, automated detection, and manual annotation.
- *Month 3:* Expand the Shiny app (still shipped as part of the package) to support metadata editing, species tagging, and export of fully annotated datasets.
- *Month 4:* Conduct extensive unit testing with real-world datasets for most package functions.
- *Month 5:* Develop comprehensive vignettes and articles covering end-to-end workflows.
- *Month 6:* Finalize documentation, prepare dissemination materials, and submit delivery blog post.


## Other aspects
The project is released under MIT license. All code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/stangandaho/ct). 
Project progress and results will be publicized through:  

- Delivery blog posts on the R Consortium blog.  
- Social media (at this time on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stangandaho/?locale=en_US)) updates and ISC meetings.  
- Vignettes and articles will be published on the package [website](https://stangandaho.github.io/ct/index.html).

## Budget & funding plan
The project will progress through three well-defined milestones, each with dedicated budget allocations.  

* *Milestone 1: Core Integration Layer (Completed)*  
This milestone established the foundation of the project by developing standardized interfaces to connect `ct` with other packages. These integration enable smooth data exchange between packages and provide users with a consistent workflow. Key functions for common data transformation, analysis, and visualization were implemented, making `ct` a practical and user-friendly tool for camera trap data processing (e.g, currently in use by [Gilles Adounke](https://doctorat.univ-toulouse.fr/as/ed/cv.pl?mat=172968&site=EDT) for his PhD program).

* *Milestone 2 ($4,000): Automated Annotation*  
It will deliver a lightweight interface for deep learningâ€“assisted animal detection, streamlined tools for metadata extraction and editing, and utilities for efficient dataset construction.

* *Milestone 3 ($4,000): Documentation, Testing, and CRAN Submission*    
The final milestone will ensure *ct* is well-documented, tested, and accessible to the R community. It includes developing comprehensive documentation, and submitting the finalized version to rOpenSci and CRAN for public release.
