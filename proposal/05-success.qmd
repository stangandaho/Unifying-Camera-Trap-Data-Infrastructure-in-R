# Success
<!--
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a
thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery
-->

## Definition of done

With Milestone 1 completed and the core integration layer delivered, success for the remaining milestones means delivering automated media annotation, an interactive Shiny interface, comprehensive documentation, and a CRAN-ready package.

## Measuring success

Success will be measured by passing tests for all new functions, successful beta testing with partner institutions, positive user feedback, and public availability of the package on CRAN with adoption signals such as downloads and GitHub activity.

## Future work

- Prepare and submit a peer-reviewed manuscript suitable for publication in Methods in Ecology and Evolution or a similar journal.
- Collaborate with other R packages and international camera trap data initiatives to enhance interoperability.
- Expand support for additional deep learning models and custom model integration for species classification.
- Continue to maintain the package.
