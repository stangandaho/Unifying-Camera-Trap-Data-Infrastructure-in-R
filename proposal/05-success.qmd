# Success

## Definition of done
With Milestone 1 completed and the core integration layer delivered, success for the remaining milestones means delivering automated media annotation, an interactive Shiny interface, comprehensive documentation, and a CRAN-ready package.

## Measuring success
Success will be measured by passing tests for all new functions, successful beta testing with partner institutions, positive user feedback, and public availability of the package on CRAN with adoption signals such as downloads and GitHub activity.

## Future work
Future work will focus on maintaining the package, adding support for additional models (species classification), and encouraging community-driven analytical extensions to broaden its impact.
