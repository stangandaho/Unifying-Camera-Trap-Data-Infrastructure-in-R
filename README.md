# ct: Unifying Camera Trap Data Infrastructure in R

## Overview

The `ct` R package aims to provide a unified, extensible infrastructure for managing, analyzing, and sharing camera trap data within the R ecosystem. This project is proposed for the Second Grant cycle of the R Consortiumâ€™s Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC).

## Motivation

Camera trap data is widely used in ecological and wildlife research, but current workflows are fragmented, with inconsistent data formats and limited interoperability. The `ct` package will address these challenges by standardizing data structures, facilitating data import/export, and supporting reproducible analyses.

## Key Features

- Standardized data models for camera trap projects
- Tools for importing, cleaning, and validating camera trap data
- Functions for data exploration, visualization, and summary
- Support for interoperability with existing R packages and external databases
- Documentation and vignettes for best practices

## Project Goals

- Lower barriers for researchers and practitioners working with camera trap data
- Promote reproducibility and data sharing in ecological research
- Foster community contributions and extensibility
